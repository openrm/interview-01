# interview-01: image processing

Thanks for your interest. We would like you to follow the instructions of this exercice and send us the versioned sources of your implementation.

## Description
In the `dataset` folder of this repository, you will find a set of images that needs to be processed.

The images are actually document scans.Â We want you to process the images, and separate pages contained in the image.

For example, for the following image:
![input](/dataset/01.png?raw=true "Input")

The output should extract the pages as shown here (the green rectangles):
![output](/instructions/result-01.png?raw=true "Output")

And save them in two separate files.

The ideal solution should work on all the files provided in the `dataset` folder, but it is OK if only a portion of them are done.

Thanks for your time, we hope you will enjoy the exercice!

## Requirements
We will check the following points:
  - Must contain at least one test
  - Must provide instructions to build and run the project
  - Must be versioned

The exercice can be done in the language of your choice, with the libs of your choice.
